**AI-powered emotion detection from speech using Deep Learning**

*"Human insight — made simple"*

</div>

## 🎯 Project Overview

SERA is an advanced Speech Emotion Detection system that uses deep learning (CNN) to identify human emotions from audio recordings. It provides both a web interface and a command-line tool, supports live microphone analysis and audio file processing, and includes a pre-trained model for quick use.
